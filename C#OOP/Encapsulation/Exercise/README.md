**Exercise: Encapsulation** 

1. **Class Box Data** 

You are given a geometric figure box with parameters **length**, **width** and **height**. Model a class **Box** that can be instantiated by the same **three parameters**. Expose to the outside world **only methods for its surface area**, **lateral surface area** and its **volume** (formulas:[ http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm)](http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm). 

A  box’s  **side**  should  **not be  zero  or  a  negative  number**.  Аdd  **data  validation**  for each  **parameter**  given  to  the **constructor**. Make a **private setter** that performs data **validation** **internally**.  

**Input** 

- On the **first three lines** you will get the **length**, **width** and **height**.  

**Output** 

- On the **next three lines** print the **surface area**, **lateral surface area** and the **volume** of the box: 

**Examples** 



|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|2 3 4 |Surface Area - 52.00 Lateral Surface Area - 40.00 Volume - 24.00 |
|1.3 1 6 |Surface Area - 30.20 Lateral Surface Area - 27.60 Volume - 7.80 |
|2 -3 4 |Width cannot be zero or negative. |
2. **Animal Farm** 

For this problem you have to **download** the provided **skeleton**. 

You should be familiar with **encapsulation** already. For this problem, you’ll be working with the **AnimalFarm project**. It contains a class **Chicken**. **Chicken** contains several **fields**, a **constructor**, several **properties** and **methods**. Your task is to **encapsulate** or **hide** anything that is **unintended for viewing** or **modification** from **outside** the class. 

**Step 1. Encapsulate Fields** 

**Fields** should be **private**. Leaving fields open for modification from outside the class is potentially **dangerous**. Make **all fields** in the **Chicken** class **private**. In case the value inside the field is needed elsewhere, use **getters** to reveal it. !

**Step 2. Ensure Classes Have a Correct State** 

Having **getters and setters** is useless, if you don’t actually use them. The **Chicken** constructor **modifies the fields directly**, which is **wrong** when there are suitable **setters** available. **Modify** the constructor to fix this issue. 

**Step 3. Validate Data Properly** 

Validate the chicken’s **name** (it cannot be **null**, **empty** or **whitespace**). In case of **invalid name**, print Exception message: **"Name cannot be empty."** . 

Validate the **age** properly, **minimum** and **maximum** **age** are provided, make use of them. In case of an **invalid age**, print Exception message: **"Age should be between 0 and 15."**. Don’t forget to **handle properly** the possibly **thrown Exceptions**. 

**Step 4. Hide Internal Logic** 

If a **method** is intended to be used only by **descendant** classes or **internally** to perform some action, there is no point in keeping them **public**. The **CalculateProductPerDay()** method is used by the **ProductPerDay** public getter. This means the method can safely be **hidden** inside the **Chicken** class by declaring it **private**. 

**Step 5. Submit Code to Judge** 

Submit your code as a **zip file** in Judge. Zip everything **except** the **bin** and **obj** **folders** within the project and submit the **single zip file** in judge. 

**Examples** 



|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|Maria 10 |Chicken Maria (age 10) can produce 1 eggs per day. |
|Maria 17 |Age should be between 0 and 15. |
3. **Shopping Spree** 

Create two classes: **class** **Person** and **class** **Product**. Each person should have a **name**, **money** and a **bag** **of products**. Each product should have a **name** and a **cost**. Name cannot be an **empty string**. Money cannot be a **negative number**.  

Create a program in which **each command** corresponds to a **person buying a product**. If the person can **afford** a product, **add** it to his bag. If a person **doesn’t have enough** money, print an **appropriate** **message** ("**{personName} can't afford {productName}**"). 

On the **first two lines** you are given **all people** and **all products**. After all purchases print **every person** in the order of **appearance** and **all products** that he has **bought** also in order of **appearance**. If **nothing was bought**, print the name of the person followed by "**Nothing bought**".  

In case of **invalid input** (negative money Exception message: "**Money cannot be negative**") or an empty name (empty name Exception message: "**Name cannot be empty**") **break** the program with an appropriate message. See the examples below: 

**Examples**
|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|<p>Peter=11;George=4 Bread=10;Milk=2; Peter Bread George Milk George Milk Peter Milk </p><p>END </p>|<p>Peter bought Bread George bought Milk George bought Milk Peter can't afford Milk Peter - Bread </p><p>George - Milk, Milk </p>|
|Maria=0 Coffee=2 Maria Coffee END |Maria can't afford Coffee Maria - Nothing bought |
|<p>John=-3 Peppers=1;Tomatoes=2;Cheese=3 John Peppers </p><p>John Tomatoes </p><p>John Cheese </p><p>END </p>|Money cannot be negative |
4. **Pizza Calories** 

A pizza is made of dough and different toppings. You should model a **class Pizza,** which should have a **name**, **dough** and **toppings** as fields. Every type of **ingredient** should have its **own class**. Every ingredient has different properties: the **dough** can be white or wholegrain and in addition, it can be crispy, chewy or homemade. The **topping** can be of type meat, veggies, cheese or sauce. **Every ingredient** should have a **weight** in grams and a method for **calculating** its calories according to its type. Calories per gram are calculated through **modifiers**. Every ingredient has 2 calories per gram as a **base** and a **modifier** that **gives** the **exact** calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a **white** **chewy** dough, weighting **100** **grams** will have 2 \* 100 \* 1.5 \* 1.1 = 330.00 **total** **calories**. 

**Your job** is to model the classes in such a way that they are **properly encapsulated** and to provide a **public** method for every pizza that **calculates its calories according to the ingredients it has**.  

**Step 1. Create a Dough Class** 

The base ingredient of a **Pizza** is the dough. First, you need to create a **class** for it. It has a **flour type,** which can be **white** or **wholegrain**. In addition, it has a **baking technique,** which can be **crispy**, **chewy** or **homemade**. A dough should have a **weight** in grams. The calories per gram of a dough are calculated **depending** on the **flour type** and the **baking technique**. Every **dough** has **2 calories** **per** **gram** as a base and a **modifier** that gives the exact calories. For example, a white dough has a modifier of 1.5, a chewy dough has a modifier of 1.1, which means that a **white** **chewy** **dough**, weighting **100** **grams** will have (2 \* 100) \* 1.5 \* 1.1 = 330.00 **total** **calories**. You are given the **modifiers** below: 

**Modifiers:**

- **White - 1.5;** 
- **Wholegrain - 1.0;** 
- **Crispy - 0.9;** 
- **Chewy - 1.1;** 
- **Homemade - 1.0;** 

Everything that the class should expose is a **getter** for the **calories per gram**. Your task is to create the class with a proper **constructor**, **fields**, **getters** and **setters**. Make sure you use the **proper access modifiers**. 

**Step 2. Validate Data for the Dough Class** 

Change the internal logic of the **Dough** class by adding a **data validation** in the **setters**. 

Make sure that if **invalid flour type** or an **invalid baking technique** is given a proper **Exception** is thrown with the message **"Invalid type of dough."**. 

The allowed weight of a dough is in the **range** [1..200] grams. If it is **outside** of this **range** throw an **Exception** with the message **"Dough weight should be in the range [1..200]."**. 

**Exception Messages** 

- **"Invalid type of dough."** 
- **"Dough weight should be in the range [1..200]."** 

Make a test in your main method that reads Doughs and prints their calories until an "**END**" command is given. 

**Examples** 



|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|Dough White Chewy 100 END |330.00 |
|Dough Tip500 Chewy 100 END |Invalid type of dough. |
|Dough White Chewy 240 END |Dough weight should be in the range [1..200]. |
**Step 3. Create a Topping Class** 

Next, you need to create a **Topping class**. It can be of four different types - **meat**, **veggies**, **cheese** or a **sauce**. A **Тopping** has a **weight** in grams. The **calories per gram** of topping are **calculated depending on its type**. The **base calories** **per gram** are **2**. Every different type of topping has a **modifier**. For example, **meat** has a **modifier of 1.2**, so a **meat** topping will have **1.2 calories per gram** (1 \* 1.2). Everything that the class should expose is a **getter** for **calories per gram**. You are given the **modifiers** below: 

Modifiers: 

- **Meat - 1.2;** 
- **Veggies - 0.8;** 
- **Cheese - 1.1;** 
- **Sauce - 0.9;** 

Your task is to create the class with a **proper** **constructor**, **fields**, **getters** and **setters**. Make sure you use the **proper** **access modifiers**.


**Step 4. Validate Data for the Topping Class** 

Change the internal logic of the **Topping** class by adding **data validation** in the **setter**. 

Make sure the **Тopping** is one of the provided types, otherwise throw a proper **Exception** with the message **"Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza."**. 

The allowed weight of a **Тopping** is in the range [1..50] grams. If it is **outside of this range** throw an **Exception** with the message **"[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50]."**. 

**Exception Messages** 

- **"Cannot place [name of invalid argument] on top of your pizza."** 
- **"[Topping type name] weight should be in the range [1..50]."** 

Make a test in your main method that reads a single dough and a topping after that and prints their calories. 

**Examples** 



|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|<p>Dough White Chewy 100 Topping meat 30 </p><p>END </p>|330.00 72.00 |
|Dough White chewy 100 Topping Krenvirshi 500 END |<p>330.00 </p><p>Cannot place Krenvirshi on top of your pizza. </p>|
|<p>Dough White Chewy 100 Topping Meat 500 </p><p>END </p>|<p>330.00 </p><p>Meat weight should be in the range [1..50]. </p>|
**Step 5. Create a Pizza Class!** 

A **Pizza** should have a **name**, some **toppings** and a **dough**. Make use of the **two classes you made earlier**. In addition, a **Pizza** should have **public getters** for its **name**, **number of toppings** and the **total calories**. The **total calories** are **calculated by summing the calories of all the ingredients a Pizza has**. Create the class using a **proper constructor**, expose a **method** for **adding a topping**, a **public** **setter** for the dough and a **getter** for the **total calories**. 

The input for a **Pizza** consists of **several** **lines**. On the first line is the **Pizza name** and on the second line, you will get input for the **dough**. On the next lines, you will receive every topping the **Pizza** has. 

If the creation of the **Pizza** was **successful,** print on a single line the name of the **Pizza** and the **total calories** it has. 

**Step 6. Validate Data for the Pizza Class** 

The **name** of the **Pizza** should **not** be an **empty string**. In addition, it should **not be longer than 15 symbols**. If it does not fit, throw an **Exception** with the message **"Pizza name should be between 1 and 15 symbols."**. 

The **number of toppings** should be in range [0..10]. If not, throw an **Exception** with the message **"Number of toppings should be in range [0..10]."**. 

Your task is to print the **name** of the **Pizza** and the **total** **calories** it has according to the examples below.
**Examples**
|**Input** |**Output** |
| - | - |
|<p>Pizza Meatless </p><p>Dough Wholegrain Crispy 100 Topping Veggies 50 </p><p>Topping Cheese 50 </p><p>END </p>|Meatless - 370.00 Calories. |
|<p>Pizza Burgas </p><p>Dough White Homemade 200 Topping Meat 123 </p><p>END </p>|Meat weight should be in the range [1..50]. |
|<p>Pizza Bulgarian Dough White Chewy 100 Topping Sauce 20 Topping Cheese 50 Topping Cheese 40 Topping Meat 10 Topping Sauce 10 Topping Cheese 30 Topping Cheese 40 Topping Meat 20 Topping Sauce 30 Topping Cheese 25 Topping Cheese 40 Topping Meat 40 </p><p>END </p>|Number of toppings should be in range [0..10]. |
|<p>Pizza Bulgarian Dough White Chewy 100 Topping Sirene 50 Topping Cheese 50 Topping Krenvirsh 20 Topping Meat 10 </p><p>END </p>|Cannot place Sirene on top of your pizza. |
5. **\*\*Football Team Generator** 

A football **Team** has variable **number of players**, a **name** and a **rating**. A **Player** has a **name** and **stats,** which are the basis for his skill level. The stats a player has are **endurance**, **sprint**, **dribble**, **passing** and **shooting**. Each stat can be an **integer** in the range [0..100]. The overall **skill** **level** of a **player** is calculated as the **average** of his **stats**. Only the **name** of a player and his **stats** should be visible to the entire outside world. **Everything** **else** should be **hidden**.


A **Team** should expose a **name**, a **rating** (calculated by the average skill level of all players in the team and **rounded** to the **integer** part only) and **methods** for **adding** and **removing** **players**. 

Your task is to **model** the **Team** and the **Player** classes following the proper principles of **Encapsulation**. Expose **only** the properties that need to be visible and **validate** **data** appropriately. 

**Input** 

Your application will receive commands until the "**END**" command is given. The command can be one of the following: 

- **"Team;{TeamName}"** - add a new **Team**; 
- **"Add;{TeamName};{PlayerName};{Endurance};{Sprint};{Dribble};{Passing};{Shooting}"** - add a new **Player** to the **Team**; 
- **"Remove;{TeamName};{PlayerName}"** -** remove the **Player** from the **Team**; 
- **"Rating;{TeamName}"** - print the **Team** rating, rounded to an integer.** 

**Data Validation** 

- A name cannot be null, empty or white space. If not, print **"A name should not be empty."** 
- Stats should be in the range 0..100. If not, print **"[Stat name] should be between 0 and 100."** 
- If you receive a command to remove a missing **Player**, print **"Player [Player name] is not in [Team name] team."** 
- If you receive a command to add a **Player** to a missing **Team**, print **"Team [team name] does not exist."** 
- If you receive a command to show stats for a missing **Team**, print **"Team [team name] does not exist."**
