**Your Task** 

**Write the missing JavaScript code** to make the **SoftUni Administration Functionality** works as follows:  The **Module field** is a dropdown menu.

When the **Add** button is **clicked**, first you need to **validate the inputs**. If any of the input fields is **invalid (empty or default value)**, the function **doesn’t** make anything. Be careful with the **validation of the Module dropdown** (it's default value is **NOT** an empty string).  

**After validating** the input fields, you need to **add** the new **lecture** in the **Trainings** section.  The HTML structure after adding new lecture looks like this:

The added lecture should have **button** with text "**Del**".  **The date** and the **lecture name** must be **formatted** as shown on the screenshots. Be careful with the **HTML-Structure** and with the **class names**! 

Duplicated names of the lectures are allowed.

**If there is another Lecture with the same Module:** 

The lectures should be **sorted by DATE**! The date is separated with **slashes** (/) and the **separator** between the **date** and **time** is a **minus sign.** 

**Hint: The format of the date allows alphabetical sort.**

**Deleting Lecture/Module:**

When the “**Delete**” button is clicked, the **Lecture (whole list element)** should be **removed** from the HTML.

If there are **NO** Lectures left in the module (after delete) the whole **module** should be **also deleted**.
