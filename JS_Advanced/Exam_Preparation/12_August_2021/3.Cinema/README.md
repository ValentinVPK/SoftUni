**JS Advanced Retake Exam** 

**Problem 3. Unit Testing** 

**Your Task** 

Using **Mocha** and **Chai** write **JS Unit Tests** to test a variable named **cinema**, which represents an object. You may use the following code as a template: 

describe(**"*Tests* …"**, **function**() { 

`    `describe(**"*TODO* …"**, **function**() {         ***it***(**"*TODO …*"**, **function**() {             *// **TODO:*** … 

`        `}); 

`     `}); 

`     `*// **TODO:*** … 

}); 

The object that should have the following functionality:  

- **showMovies(movieArr)**-A function that accepts an array:** 
- The array includes the available movies in the cinema ([‘King Kong’, ‘The Tomorrow War’, ‘Joker’,etc.])** 
- If the length of the input array is zero, the function returns the string: "**There are currently no movies to show.**" 
- Otherwise, the function returns:  an array of available movies, separated by a comma and space 
- There is no need for validation for the input, you will always be given an array 
- **ticketPrice(projectionType)**- A function that accept string:** 
- The function checks whether the submitted projectionType is present in the schedule with the types of projections 
- If present in the schedule, return the price according to the type 
- Otherwise, the function throws an error in the following format "**Invalid projection type.**" 
- There is no need for validation for the input 
- **swapSeatsInHall(firstPlace, secondPlace)**- A function that accepts two numbers** 
- The function swaps the seat number in the cinema hall, when two numbers are submitted.** 
- The exchange is not successful and the function returns "**Unsuccessful** **change of seats in the hall.**" : 
  - If one of the two numbers do not exist 
  - The numbers are not integers 
  - If one of the numbers is greater than the capacity of the hall – **20** 
  - Seats are less or equal of **0** 
- Otherwise return: "**Successful change of seats in the hall.**" 
- There is a need for validation for the input 

**JS Code** 

To ease you in the process, you are provided with an implementation which meets all of the specification requirements for the **cinema** object: 



|**cinema.js** |
| - |
|const cinema = { |
|showMovies: function(movieArr) { |
||
|if (movieArr.length == 0) { |
|return 'There are currently no movies to show.'; |
|} else { |
|let result = movieArr.join(', '); |
|return result; |
|} |
||
|}, |
|ticketPrice: function(projectionType) { |
||
|const schedule = { |
|"Premiere": 12.00, |
|"Normal": 7.50, |
|"Discount": 5.50 |
|} |
|if (schedule.hasOwnProperty(projectionType)) { |
|let price = schedule[projectionType]; |
|return price; |
|} else { |
|throw new Error('Invalid projection type.') |
|} |
||
|}, |
|swapSeatsInHall: function(firstPlace, secondPlace) { |
||
|if (!Number.isInteger(firstPlace) || firstPlace <= 0 || firstPlace > 20 || |
|!Number.isInteger(secondPlace) || secondPlace <= 0 || secondPlace > 20 || |
|firstPlace === secondPlace) { |
|return "Unsuccessful change of seats in the hall."; |
|} else { |
|return "Successful change of seats in the hall."; |
|} |
||
|} |
|` `}; |
